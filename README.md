# Knight's Tour Puzzle

## About
The Knightâ€™s Tour is a fun puzzle where you move the knight so that it visits every square of the chessboard once. 

## Rules
The knight is a chess piece. It moves in an L-shape and can jump over other pieces. It has to move 2 squares horizontally and 1 square vertically, or 2 squares vertically and 1 square horizontally.

- The knight can start at any square.
- The knight must visit every square by moving in the L-shape.
- The knight can visit each square only once.
- The knight can finish anywhere on the board. This is called an 'open' tour of the board.
- You win if you visit every square on the board.
- You lose if you fail to visit every square only once without revisiting it.
